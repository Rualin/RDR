# Recognition of doctor's conclusions

## About
Our team is creating a web-based solution for recognizing a doctor's conclusions based on photographs using machine learning models.

## Objectives

- Creation of a module that will recognize text from a photo
- Creation and training of a model that will analyze the recognized text and present it in the format required by the user
- Presentation of the results of our work in a user-friendly way, with a clear interface

## Technologies

- DocTR is a framework that will recognize text from images and twist it into a convenient form for later use.
- NLP model - the model to which we will submit the text recognized by the DocTR and which will extract the information necessary for the user from it.
- GitHub Pages is a simple and intuitive service of the GitHub platform that makes it easy to create a website based on your repository

## Team members
